SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Data Analysis
Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and data files for analyzing SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data. The project focuses on predicting the success of first stage landings and exploring factors influencing mission outcomes.

Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:
    1_Data_collecton_API: Request to the SpaceX API and data cleaning
    2_Web_scraping: Extracting Falcon 9 launch records HTML table from Wikipedia
    3_Data_wrangling: Data preprocessing and cleaning.
    4_EDA_SQL: Database creation and Query
    5_EDA_Viz: Visualizations and exploratory insights.
    6_Machine_learning: Model training, evaluation, and predictions.


Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches). 
The original dataset includes information on Falcon 9 launches, payloads, outcomes, and other relevant mission details.

Methods and Techniques
Data Wrangling: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing launch trends, mission success rates, and correlations.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and other models to predict launch success based on historical data.
